# Breast Cancer Classification

## Overview
This project is focused on classifying breast cancer cases using Deep learning techniques. The dataset undergoes preprocessing before being used to train a neural network model implemented with TensorFlow and Keras.  

## Features
- Data preprocessing using pandas and scikit-learn
- Deep learning model built with TensorFlow/Keras
- Performance evaluation using accuracy and classification report  

## Installation
To run this project, install the required dependencies:

```
pip install pandas scikit-learn tensorflow
```

## Usage
- Load and preprocess the dataset  
- Train the neural network model  
- Evaluate performance using accuracy and classification report  

## Libraries Used
- **pandas** for data handling  
- **scikit-learn** for preprocessing and evaluation  
- **tensorflow.keras** for building the neural network  

## Results
The model achieved an accuracy of **98%+**, demonstrating its effectiveness in classifying breast cancer cases. Performance was evaluated using accuracy scores and classification reports.

## Future Improvements

- Hyperparameter tuning for improved performance.
- Implementing more complex deep learning architectures.
- Deploying the model as a web application for easy access.
- Integration with real-time medical imaging analysis.
